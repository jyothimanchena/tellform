<h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></h4>

<strong>nonimmigrant</strong> visa status (see exception below for students who have been granted T or U visa status),
who meets all of the following requirements, shall be exempt from paying nonresident tuition at the
California Community Colleges, the University of California, and the California State University (all public
colleges and universities in California).1</p>

<li style="padding-left:70px;">Requirements:</li>
<li style="list-style-type:circle;padding-left:130px;">The student must have:</li>
<li style="padding-left:150px;">attended a high school (public or private) in California for three or more years, or</li>
<li style="padding-left:150px;">• attained credits earned in California from a California high school equivalent to three or more years of full-time high school course work and attended a

</li>
<li style="list-style-type:circle;padding-left:130px;">The student must file an affidavit with the college or university stating that he or she has
filed an application to legalize his or her immigration status, or will file an application as soon as he or she is eligible to do so
.</li>
<li style="padding-left:70px;">Students who are nonimmigrants who are victims of trafficking, domestic violence, and other
serious crimes who have been granted T or U visa status, under Title 8 of the United States
Code, sections 1101(a)(15)(T) or (U) are eligible for this exemption.3</li>
<li style="padding-left:70px;">Students who are nonimmigrants, other than those with T or U visa status as noted above, [for
example, those who hold F (student) visas, B (visitor) visas, etc.] are not eligible for this
exemption</li>
<li style="padding-left:70px;"> The student must file an exemption request including a signed affidavit with the college that
indicates the student has met all applicable conditions described above. Student information
obtained in this process is strictly confidential unless disclosure is required under law.</li>
<li style="padding-left:70px;"> Students eligible for this exemption who are transferring to another California public college or
university must submit a new request (and documentation if required) to each college under consideration.</li>
<li style="padding-left:70px;">Nonresident students meeting the criteria will be exempted from the payment of nonresident
tuition, but they will not be classified as California residents. They continue to be “nonresidents”.</li>

<li style="padding-left:70px;"> The California Dream Act extends Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, Cal Grant C awards,
Chaffee grants, and institutional financial aid to students that meet these criteria as well as the
applicable criteria for eligibility for specific types of financial aid</li>
<li style="padding-left:70px;">AB540 does not provide federal student financial aid eligibility for undocumented students.
These students remain ineligible for federal financial aid.</li><br><br><br>
